(Done)
# Memory for storing playground
    - 16 x 32 bit


(Done)
# Display output
    - Playground memory will be directly mapped to display.


(Done) !!!Prerobit/aktualizovat!!!
# Registers for storing active object
    - X and Y registers.
    - 4 positions per register (number of pixels per object is 4).
    - 5 bits per position (2 ^ 5 > playground dimensions).


(Done)
# Basic Counter/Looper
    - 2-bit counter (0 -> 3).
    - Counter will be used to loop through each pixel of the active object to perform further action (draw, erase, wall detection, ...).


# Single Step Sequencer
    - Erase active object.
        - Store 4 zeros to memory (4 cycles).
    - Move/rotate active object.
        - Add +/-1 to all points of active object (4 cycles).
    - Redraw active object.
        - Store 4 ones to memory (4 cycles).
    - Detect collisions.
        - Compare all points of active object with bottom/walls.


# Game Sequencer


# Basic clock frequency
    - f = 32768Hz
    - Implement dedicated 15-bit game speed counter (2 ^ 15 = 32768).


# Basic game speed
    - T = 1s
    - Speed at the beginning of a new game.


# Speed increase
    - After every 10 points, increase game speed.


# Input buttons reaction speed
    - T = 0.1s
    - Defines how fast can active object move (to side or to bottom) when button is pressed.


# Object generation
    - Objects will be generated randomly from predefined shapes.
    - Use (pseudo) random number generator.


(Done)
# Object drawing/erasing (storing to/ erasing from playground memory)
    - Drawn object (already copied to playground memory) will be deleted from that memory.
    - Active object will be copied from register to playground memory.


# Object shift (vertical/horizontal)
    - Active object can be shifted by player`s input downwards and to the sides.


(Done)
# Object rotation
    - Active object can be rotated in one direction.


# Wall detection
    - Before every redraw, check if active object reached a playground wall.
    - Loop through all pixels of the active object.
    - Check if one position to left or to right from active object (X + 1 or X - 1) is already placed pixel.


# Bottom detection
    - Before every redraw, check if object reached the bottom of the playground.
    - Loop through all pixels of the active object.
    - Check if one position bellow active object (Y + 1) is already placed pixel.


# Complete bottom line check
    - Check if all pixels on the very bottom line of the playground are set.
    - Perform this check every time when active object is redrawn.


# Playground shifting
    - In case of the bottom line fully set, shift entire playground by one pixel downwards.
    - Connect all pixels in each vertical line as a shift register.


# Score counter
    - After every playground shift, add one point.


# Game over detection
    - If active object immediately after its creation touches the playground bottom then game over.


# Game restart
    - Erase screen using the "wave up and down" effect.
    - Reset the score counter.


# Sound effects
    - Clean screen
    - New object / old object was placed
    - Move object
    - Shift playground down
    - End game
